                <h2>CLERIC</h2>
                <p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner
                    light
                    that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.

                    Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs
                    arrayed
                    against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foeâ€™s fall.

                    Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from
                    it to
                    drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.

                    Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as
                    the
                    gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a
                    cleric
                    is imbued with divine magic.</p>

                <h2>WARLOCK</h2>
                <p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a
                    magical
                    charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.

                    As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic
                    patron,
                    infusing her spell with fiendish magic.

                    Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed
                    tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.

                    Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through
                    pacts
                    made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
                    spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags,
                    and
                    alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
