# javascript-background-fade

A simple test concept using Jquery to animate a smooth transitional color change when a user scrolls down the page.
When a user scrolls 200 pixels down, the background color transitions from a flat white to a nearly full black, with text color smoothly transitioning to white to prevent visibility issues. Simple test drill suggested by a designer friend.
